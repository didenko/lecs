`asion` namespace is a factored-out portion of _asio_'s `c11/http/server` example. Unlike the `httpl` namespace this is the code which gathers the example's underlying network communication behaviours.

The goal was to extract code which which may be more universal than the http server example. This refactoring also is an experiment in creating a generic enough interface to such connectivity code which is simpler than the full asio access.
